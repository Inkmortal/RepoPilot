# Product Context: RepoPilot

This document details the "why" behind RepoPilot, the problems it aims to solve, and how it intends to function from a user perspective.

## 1. Problem Space

Developers working with Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation, analysis, or refactoring often face challenges when dealing with large codebases:

-   **Context Window Limits:** LLMs have finite context windows. Feeding an entire large repository is often impossible or impractical.
-   **Irrelevant Information:** Including unnecessary code files or sections in a prompt dilutes the relevant information, leading to less accurate or useful LLM responses (hallucinations, off-topic suggestions).
-   **Manual Effort:** Manually selecting and copying relevant code snippets is time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious.
-   **Privacy Risks:** Copying and pasting potentially sensitive or proprietary code into third-party web UIs poses significant security and privacy risks.
-   **Applying Changes:** Integrating LLM suggestions back into the codebase can be cumbersome, especially for complex changes across multiple files.

## 2. Target Audience

-   Software developers working on the Windows platform.
-   Developers utilizing LLMs as part of their development workflow (e.g., for code generation, debugging, refactoring, documentation).
-   Teams or individuals working with large, complex codebases.
-   Developers concerned about the privacy and security of their codebase when using LLMs.

## 3. Proposed Solution: RepoPilot

RepoPilot addresses these problems by providing a dedicated, local-first Windows tool that acts as an intelligent intermediary between the developer's codebase and the LLM.

**How it Works (User Perspective):**

1.  **Select Codebase:** The user points RepoPilot to a local project directory.
2.  **Filter & Select Files:** The user utilizes RepoPilot's UI (integrated with File Explorer or within the app) to browse the codebase. They can apply filters (by type, size, name patterns) or manually select specific files and folders relevant to their task.
3.  **Analyze & Structure:** RepoPilot analyzes the selected files, potentially parsing code structures (classes, functions - the "CodeMap"). It estimates the token count.
4.  **Generate Prompt:** Based on the selection and analysis, RepoPilot constructs a structured prompt (e.g., XML format) containing only the relevant code fragments, potentially with metadata.
5.  **Use Prompt:** The user copies the generated prompt to their clipboard and pastes it into their preferred LLM interface (web chat, API script, etc.).
6.  **(Optional) Apply Diffs:** If the LLM provides suggestions in a compatible structured format (e.g., an XML diff), the user can potentially use RepoPilot to apply these changes back to their local files safely.

## 4. User Experience Goals

-   **Seamless Integration:** Feel like a natural part of the Windows development environment.
-   **Intuitive Control:** Provide clear and easy-to-use controls for file selection and filtering.
-   **Transparency:** Clearly display selected files, token estimates, and the structure of the generated prompt.
-   **Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the time and effort required to create effective LLM prompts from code.
-   **Privacy Assurance:** Give users confidence that their code remains local and private.
-   **Precision:** Enable accurate application of LLM-suggested changes through structured diffs.
