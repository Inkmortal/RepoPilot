# Project Progress: RepoPilot

This document tracks the overall status of the RepoPilot project, what components are functional, what remains to be built, and any known issues.

## 1. Overall Status

-   **Phase:** Core Feature Implementation
-   **Current State:** The project is now a functional Electron application. Users can open a local repository, and the file structure is displayed in the file explorer component. State management for the repository is handled by Zustand.

## 2. What Works

-   **Electron Application:** Basic Electron shell is functional; the application launches as a desktop app.
-   **Repository Selection:** Users can click "Open Repo" to trigger a native directory selection dialog.
-   **File Structure Loading:** The selected directory's structure is read by the Electron main process and sent to the frontend via IPC.
-   **File Explorer UI (Dynamic):** The `FileExplorer` component displays the actual file tree based on the loaded repository data from the Zustand store.
-   **State Management:** Zustand store (`repositoryStore.ts`) manages the loaded repository path and file structure.
-   **Basic Interactions:** Expanding/collapsing folders and selecting/deselecting files in the tree updates the state.
-   **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files are updated to reflect Electron integration.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High Level - Refined)

-   **File Content Preview:** Implement IPC to fetch actual file content when a file is clicked in `SelectedFiles.tsx`.
-   **Code Parsing/Indexing ("CodeMap"):** Integrate parsing libraries (e.g., tree-sitter) into the main process to extract structural info.
-   **Token Estimation Logic:** Implement accurate token counting based on selected file content.
-   **Prompt Generation Logic:** Build the UI and logic (`PromptBuilder.tsx`) to assemble prompts from selected/parsed code.
-   **Structured Diff Application Logic:** Implement parsing and application of diffs.
-   **UI State Enhancements:** Refine state management for filters, search persistence, etc.
-   **Windows Integration:** Implement context menus, etc.
-   **Testing:** Add unit/integration tests for IPC, file reading, state management, and UI components.
-   **Build/Packaging Refinement:** Test and refine the Electron Builder configuration.
-   **Error Handling:** Improve error handling for file system access, IPC, and UI interactions.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   Potential TypeScript configuration issues (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`) identified during setup may require manual review.
-   File content preview in `SelectedFiles.tsx` currently shows mock content.

## 5. Completed Milestones

-   Initial project description analysis.
-   Creation of the core Memory Bank documentation structure.
-   **Electron Integration:** Successfully converted the project to an Electron application.
-   **Repository Loading Implementation:** Implemented the core "Open Repo" and file tree population functionality.
-   **State Management Setup:** Integrated Zustand for repository state.
